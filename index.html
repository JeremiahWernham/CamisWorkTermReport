			            <h2 class="page-title">Introduction</h2>
			            <p>DevOps is a set of practices, first popularized in 2009 by Patrick Debas, that ensures collaboration and communication between software engineers and IT operations. At Camis Inc., the DevOps team maintains the continuous delivery of changes and new features to the applications Camis offers through continuous delivery pipelines. The team uses checkpoints at each step of the packaging, testing, and deployment stages of software development to amplify feedback loops and provide precise information to developers. Automation is also a large part of the role as many repetitive tasks are eliminated through scripting languages and technologies meant to save time and effort. Duties such as administering cloud computing infrastructure and application operations based on actual or expected consumer load, or even providing support for other teams and critical company technologies, are the day-to-day responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer. </p>
						<h2>Information About The Employer</h2>  
						<p>Camis Inc. is a Canadian software company creating full-featured camping management systems and offers end-to-end services from website to campsite. It’s head office in Guelph, Camis is the leading provider for provincial park and backcountry camping solutions to help guests reserve, check-in, and enjoy their stay. Camis clients include Parks Canada, Ontario Provincial Parks, and Michigan State Parks and Harbours, and Washington State Parks in the United States, as well as many more.</p>
						<p>Camis started with the simple idea that campsite reservation and equipment rentals can be made easier with computer technology. What began as a DOS program in the park office of founder, Doug Hall, Camis strengthens its product offering with the release of Camis 5. As both a desktop application for park staff, and web application that allows reservations to be made completely online, this software system uses cloud computing technology to meet the computational demand of park guests looking to book their spots as soon as the reservation period opens.</p> 
						<p>Camis Inc. is continuously growing with implementations across North America and is focused on following an agile development approach for flexibility and innovation. With the call centre team dedicated to providing the utmost customer service, development teams continuously refining the software’s products and features, and IT systems teams ensuring smooth operations, Camis remains top competitor among camping management system service providers.</p>
