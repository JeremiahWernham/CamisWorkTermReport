		                	<p>In conclusion, my role as a DevOps Co-op at Camis Inc. was beneficial to my career goal of working in an agile software development environment with emphasis on continuous delivery. I gained a deeper understanding of how cloud computing is superior to physical infrastructure and how it can be managed to meet the needs of clients and users in a way that minimizes associated costs. Through the direct development of scheduled tasks to automatically run defined scripts when triggered, I've begun to understand the way that a team using DevOps methodologies can be a powerful tool within a company as continual automation when developing and maintaining any application is a saver of time and energy. By gaining a deeper understanding of the technologies and programming languages used to create continuous delivery pipelines, and the work required to ensure integration of new code to the codebase is done as smoothly as possible, I confident in my ability to continuously learn new technologies and work again in DevOps in the future.</p>
